            <p>Pride Tutoring was founded by a group of educators who saw the need for an inclusive tutoring service for
                students of all backgrounds. They believed that every student deserves the opportunity to succeed and
                created a company to provide personalized support at the secondary and tertiary levels. Pride Tutoring
                quickly gained a reputation for excellence and remains committed to its mission of helping every student
                reach their full potential.</p>
